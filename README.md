## INTRODUCTION
A  data structure project to build simple terminal version of the popular word guessing game, Wordle, in Java. This was made for my DS Lab assignment project.

## HOW TO PLAY WORDLE
You have six tries to guess the five-letter secret word. The secret word may contain duplicate letters, like "hello".

After each guess, the colour of the letter tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the actual secret word.

After a six unsuccessful guesses, you fail and the correct answer will be displayed.

The green tile indicates that the letter you guessed is right and is in the right position.
The yellow tile indicates that the letter you guessed is right but it is in different position.
The black tile indicates that the letter you guesses is not in the word.
